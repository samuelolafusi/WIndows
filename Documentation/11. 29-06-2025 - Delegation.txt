Delegation Control - delegating tasks on ADDS, restricting access to other things.

- Created New user - Issy
- Created new OU - Vendors (this is the OU for different vendors for products that the office uses).
- Added Issy to Vendors OU.
- Delegated control to Issy to only reset users' passwords.
	- On AD users/Computers, right click on the Domain, click Delegate control, and follow the steps.
	- Allowed Issy to reset users' passwords and to change their passwords on next logon

- The result was tested by logging in on one of the domain computers with the RSAT tools installed.
	- I opened AD Users/Computers, went to the HR OU, right-clicked on one of the users, and only the reset password function worked.
	- Also, right clicking on any user, clicking on properties, under the account tab, only the "users should change password at next logon" was allowed, all other check boxes were greyed out.
	- Also, under the security tab in properties, nothing can be done by Issy.
	- I also viewed this delegation by checking the properties of the user (note, I enabled advanced features under View in AD users/computers)
		- Under the security tab -> advanced -> under the access column for the user, the set delegation was shown. 


Account Lockout and Management Tools by Microsoft

- Simulated a locked user account - Issy
- Used Event Viewer in Computer Management in AD users/computers on the domain controller to check a record of what happened
	- Windows -> Security logs -> find <username>, username was Issy in this case
	- A report about the locked account was recorded.

To view more details about what happened specifically with the user's password, the tool below was used.

- Used Lockoutstatus.exe (an extract from Account Lockout and Management Tools).
	- File -> select target -> input the locked user's name.
	- Details about this user's locked event are displayed.

- Right on this tool, the account was unlocked because I have the permission to do that.
	- Right-click on the user result, click on "unlock account."
