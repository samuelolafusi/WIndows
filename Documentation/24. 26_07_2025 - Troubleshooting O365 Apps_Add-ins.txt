Outlook

- I practiced troubleshooting on Outlook, removing, repairing, and uninstalling plugins

- I started Outlook in safe mode, using the command switch, to start Outlook in its bare form
	outlook.exe /safe

- I managed add-ins by;
	outlook -> file -> options -> add-ins -> manage add-ins, go -> uncheck/recheck -> ok
	uninstall, reinstall, repair, remove add-ins

- I also tried removing (not deleting) the user's Outlook file from the Outlook directory
	Outlook -> file -> info -> account setup -> account setup -> data -> open file location.
	control panel -> large icons -> mail -> data files -> open file location 

- I also worked on removing the user's profile through mail in the control panel. 
- This could affect the user preferences and cached data; it is advised to back up the file, as in the previous step.
	control panel -> large icons -> mail -> profile -> remove

- One could also add a new profile to test if the existing profile is corrupted or not, input the profile name, and the email account details.
	control panel -> large icons -> mail -> profile -> add


Excel

- I started Excel in safemode (Forces Excel to bypass all files/add-ins that are stored in startup directories) by;
	run -> excel.exe /s or /safemode

- I managed add-ins by;
	excel -> file -> options -> add-ins -> manage add-ins, go -> uncheck/recheck -> ok

- If Excel is working on its own, but a particular file that was opened some time ago is no longer opening, use the previous versions of Excel files by
	right-click on the file -> properties -> previous versions -> open/restore

- If the file is opening, but on clicking a tab, it crashes, the move or copy feature for sheets could work.
This would create a copy of that sheet and into a new file (book)
	open the file -> right-click on the sheet -> move or copy -> "move selected sheets", select new book, check "create a copy"

- Another way to repair a book is to use the open and repair feature of Excel.
	excel -> file -> open other workbooks -> browse -> click once on the bad file (don't double click) -> under the open drop down on the right, select "open and repair" -> click repair.

- An autosave version of the file could be in the autosave directory; 
	appdata -> roaming -> Microsoft -> Excel (if the file is available, just copy)
	The XLSTART folder represents the user's preferences for Excel


Word

- I started Word in safe mode by;
	run -> winword /safe

- I managed add-ins by;
	word -> file -> options -> add-ins -> manage add-ins, go -> uncheck/recheck -> ok

- I started Word to prevent add-ins and global templates from being loaded automatically
	run -> winword /a

- I started word with no document open by;
	run -> winword /n

- I started work to re-register in the Windows registry by;
	run -> winword /r
