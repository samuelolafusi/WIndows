- Set up a free trial Microsoft 365 E5 subscription for learning.

- Practised and solved issues with Command-line switches @ https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/command-line-switches-for-microsoft-office-products-079164cd-4ef5-4178-b235-441737deb3a6#ID0EAABAAA=&category=outlook

Quick solution - Use OWA - Outlook Web App for the time being.

- Used the run dialog with switching commands to launch Outlook in different states. The tested switches are:

	- outlook.exe /a "d:\linux.py", I used this open outlook from run, to create a new mail item and attach linux.py

	- outlook.exe /cleancategories, I created two categories and tested the command. i used the command to open outlook and to clean all categories i created, restoring all back to defaults.
	Note: the cleancategories switch will not remove default outlook categories.

	- outlook.exe /cleanclientrules, I created three rules to move mails from specific users into a specific folders, and then, tested the switch, the switch opened outlook and removed all the rules i created. the commad deletes clint-based rules.

	- outlook.exe /cleanserverrules, this will remove server-based rules. i did not test this.

	- outlook.exe /cleanrules, this will remove client-based and server-based rules. i did not test this.

	- outlook.exe /cleanviews, to test this switch, i created two views with different layouts, tested the command, the views were deleted after outlook started.

	- outlook.exe /finder, tested this switch by running the command, it opened the advanced search dialog and was able to find mails with names, addresses, words.
