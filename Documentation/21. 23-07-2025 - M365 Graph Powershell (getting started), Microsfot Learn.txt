Some advantages of PowerShell for M365
- Reveal additional information that you can't see in the Microsoft 365 admin center
- Configure features and settings only possible with PowerShell
- Do bulk operations
- Filter data
- Print or save data
- Manage across services

- Windows PowerShell (with prerequisites, see them online) or PowerShell 7 could be used

- Installed the PowerShellGet module on Windows PowerShell - a prerequisite. (-force is to force the installation of an updated version side by side with an old version).
	command: install-module -force powershellget

- The execution policy on PowerShell must be set to remote signed. I used the command below to verify this
	command: get-executionpolicy

- To set the execution policy to remote signed, run;
	command: Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

- I connected to my M365 organization account using the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK
- These are one-time installations; however, updates need to be done.

	- installing the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK (Microsoft.graph)
		command: Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser

	- installing the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK (microsoft.graph.beta)
		command: install-module Microsoft.graph.beta

- I verified the installed graph modules;
	command: Get-InstalledModule Microsoft.Graph

	command: Update-Module Microsoft.Graph
