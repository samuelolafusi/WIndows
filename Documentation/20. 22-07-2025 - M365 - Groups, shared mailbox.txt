At the time of this writing, M365 allows the following;
- owners per group - 100
- Groups a user can create: 250
- Groups an admin can create by default - 500k
- number of members - 1000 (more can be added, but there will be delays in communication)
- Number of groups a user can be a member of: 1000
- file storage - 1TB and expandable
- Group mailbox size - 50Gb

- Created HR and vendors Microsoft 365 group (because of its collaborative feature, restore feature).
	- specifying all information and settings
	- group owner as admin
	- Sensitivity was set to none, and privacy was set to private

- Created distribution list
- Created security group.

- Tested the delete function on all three to see the effect of restoration.


Shared Mailbox

- Created a shared mailbox for tech support, specified information, added users, set permissions (read & manage, send as, send on behalf), and managed Exchange settings.

- Assessed the mailbox through Outlook on the web using the "open another mailbox" function

- Manually added the shared mailbox on Outlook desktop

- Deleted the mailbox and restored it under deleted users; however, the restored object initially becomes a user.

	- Under active users, select the restored shared mailbox, and "unblock signin."
	- Renamed the username from the Microsoft gibberish to the previous username before deleting
	- Then, after some time, reverts to a shared mailbox with all its previous settings, although this shared mailbox was still appearing under active user.

- The restored mailbox could also be converted to a shared mailbox in the Exchange Admin Center
