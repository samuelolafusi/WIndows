- i attached specific pcs to which a user can logon with this command;
	net user mary /domain /workstations:pc1,pc2,pc3

- i setup outlook on all domain pcs, using users email addresses atached to thier mailboxes on exchange server to signin.

- Outlook users signins on pcs were suceessfull.

- Sucessfully sent and received emails btw users.

- I created three universal distribution groups on exchnage server (including all necesary options) for HR dept, IT dept, and All users in the domain.

Note: distribution groups created on AD were not reflecting on exchnage server, i had to create them on exchnage, then it refleted on AD.

- I got an error with exchnage server "Local host is unable to handle this request, HTTP Error 500" i solved this error by clearing cache, resetting site permissions, deleting site data.

- I analyzed exchange server log files examining its contents.
