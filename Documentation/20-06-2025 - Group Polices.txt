GPO, RSOPs
- Created a New group policy(HR policy) under Group Policy Objects in the Group Policy Management app in AD
- added the HR OU as a delegate to read (permission) the policy - all HR users will be able only to read the policy
- Linked NEW_Policy to the HR OU
- Right click on the new policy under HR, enable "enforced", click edit to edit the policy

- Tried so many policies under user and computer configuration. examined the effects of the policies on the user
	- Encountered an error when trying to manage PC2 and PC3 from AD Users and Computers, resolved it by creating a computer config firewall rule
	- There are two ways to fix the issue: 1. Create a computer configuration Windows firewall group policy, or 2. Allow the inbound predefined services on each PC.
	- Created another policy called: PC policy for a computer config firewall policy for remote management of computers (the rules are: COM+ Network access, all rules in the Remote event log management group)
		computer config -> Windows settings -> security settings -> Windows Firewall with Advanced Security -> Inbound Rules -> new rule -> predefined -> COM+ Network access -> allow the coonection -> finish
	- used the command <gpupdate /force> to effect the user config policies on the user immediately
	- Restarted pc for computer configs policies to take effect

	- Lessons: A group policy object must be linked to an OU, and the intended objects must belong to that OU. Also, it is better to add its intended objects(users/groups/computers) under security filtering/delegation

- Generate RSoP report for users and computers in AD users and computers and with cmd commands (gpresult).
