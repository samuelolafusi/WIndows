WS16 - Shared drives, Security groups, Permissions, Mapping

- SMB shared resource (folder) creation and permission
- Created shared folders on WS16 based on OUs by;
	- server manager -> file and storage services -> shares

- Created security groups, and added users to the security groups
	Creation - AD Users and computers -> Users -> New -> group -> security group (input the group name)
	Adding - AD Users and computers -> OU of User -> Right-click on user (Add to a group) or right-click -> Properties -> Member of tab -> Add

- Modified security/sharing for shared folder to allow only authorized users in the security group to access the folder
	permission - go to folder -> right click -> properties -> security tab -> advanced -> Disable inheritance -> Delete the unauthorized users/groups -> add -> select a principle (add the users/group that should have access) 
			-> Check basic permissions options -> apply

	sharing - go to folder -> right click -> properties -> sharing tab -> share -> edit permission levels for added user/groups -> share
	Note: when editing permission levels under sharing, the already added principals (under security) should appear

- Mapped the folder on workstations
	on the server -> go to the shared folder -> right click -> properties -> sharing tab -> copy the network path
	on the PC -> File explorer -> right click on "this pc" -> map a network drive -> check "reconnect at login"
	tested it by trying all permissions on a file in the shared drives, and checking on the server and other PCs.

- Mapped the personal folder to users on AD Users and computers
	open AD users and computers -> go to the user in OU -> right click -> properties -> profile tab -> home profile section -> select "connect" and input the path
	Note: The path is in this format. \\server_name\path_to_folder\%username%
